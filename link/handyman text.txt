Hope no more leaks. Strongly recommended, will ask again for future works. Thanks a lot.AureenpykPeter is very prompt in responding and fast service. Issue resolved quickly. Will seek his help again if there’s any plumbing issue in future.. thank you.ErthgAmazing work! I engaged him to install 3bedroom curtain rods and 4 shelvings in the kitchen. He was supper professionally, all drilling work had little dust because he used a good quality drill that came with a vacuum each time it drilled. For the shelves he did levelling before drilling.  Overall I must say I am very satisfied and will engage him again.Call us at 9178 7269, 9387 0196 for quotation, or whatapp/email to us your requirement.(Please send to us the list of jobs, and your location)Jobs has been doneReplace Table TopRaplace door lockFixing cabinet’s door    Installation wardrobe from ChinaBuild-in tray for oven on the existing old cabinetInstall extendablelaundry dryerRe-size cabinet’s doorTestimonialhome      contact us       jobs     testimonial
